Cat Shelter

The Cat Shelter website is a simple one page website with links to different parts of the page. The purpose of the website is to raise awareness of the cat shelter, to raise funds for the cat shelter and to make it easy for people to adopt cats from the cat shelter.

Users of this website will be able to read about the cat shelter, learn about the cats available for adoption and donate money.

Testing

My website was tested with the following tools:

- various browsers

- <https://validator.w3.org/>. The first test showed a few errors, I corrected these and then did another test that had no errors.

Bugs

For the wider desktop computer media query I copied and pasted the media query for narrow desktop computers while forgetting to update the width. This led to lots of problems with the layout but when I fixed it all of those problems were resolved.

The donate button wasn't responsive because the left and right padding was in pixels. I solved this by adding a percentage left and right padding.

The fixed header had to be removed for larger screens as it was covering part of the grid below it and that didn't work with the design. It did work with mobile as there was a picture below it that could be partially covered without messing up the design.
